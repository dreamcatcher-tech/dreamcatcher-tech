This is the means by which to introduce external data into the blockchain based system, in a way that does not corrupt the key blockchain property of reproducibility.

Side effects are any external event - something that cannot be reproduced - a simple example is receiving an email. The converse is required too - being able to use the pure, clean, secure blockchain based calculations to trigger unreproducible external events.
