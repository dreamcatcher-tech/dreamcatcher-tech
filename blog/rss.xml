It's headmark vs compass bearing thing.</p><p>The general rule is that you should always know what your '1-up' is trying to do, regardless is what he's telling you to do. It's recognising that centralised command and control is inferior to decentralised command and control, but by decentralising, you could give misfires. You need to let the guys know not only what you think they need to do, but why you've asked them to do it.</p><p>So the strategic intent is the high level "Start with why". That's needed because it's not possible to write the tactical intent (the compass bearing) in sufficient detail to avoid fuck ups by itself, you need to give a headmark. But it's not enough to just state why you're trying to do something (the headmark), without giving some guidance.</p><p>The Ratcatchers and Regulators thing comes from Admiral Beatty and Admiral Jellicoe in WW1. Beatty was the ratcatcher, and didn't plan ahead at all well, and gave full reign to the captains under his command. Didn't go well, as they each had a different idea of what the overall objective was, and so perfectly executed their own commands, just in different directions. Jellicoe was the Regulator, and literally had a huge book of rules which all the captains under his command had to follow, and so was exceptionally brittle as soon as the hun came over the horizon.</p><p>The middle ground is the way. Don't over specify, don't leave people in doubt of what the whole point of the thing is.</p><p>So it's fundamentally different from nested Requests, in that strategy is about why, then there's a phase change to tactical which is about how, what, where etc.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>"Restoring Fair Reward: Dreamcatcher's Packet-Based Innovation Rekindles the Ancient Link between Contribution and Attribution"</em></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="bing: an image representing the ancient primal link between contribution and attribution, work and reward" src="/assets/images/2023-05-23-primal-needs-f3dfdd015df67e0fcfcc6be70fa5d276.jpeg" width="1024" height="1024" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>From the earliest days of humanity, the drive to contribute and to be fairly rewarded for our effort has been a fundamental part of our nature. This primal, animalistic desire for fair attribution has influenced the formation of societies, economies, and even our individual identities. Yet, in our current economic system, it appears that the link between contribution and reward, between effort and income, has become increasingly tenuous. The flow of wealth from its source to those who contribute to its creation seems distorted and, in some cases, corrupted. This raises the question: how can we restore this essential link? The answer may lie in an innovative approach – packet-based innovation.</p><p>Dreamcatcher, an open, packetized innovation market, offers a groundbreaking solution to this problem. By employing a packet-based innovation model, it reinstates the direct connection between economic reward and the value of members' contributions. In this system, members deal in 'Packets' - unitary pieces of software or documented knowledge whose quality has been verified by a trusted, disinterested Quality Assurance (QA) process, and which address an identified need.</p><p>In essence, each packet represents a quantifiable unit of contribution. The QA process ensures that each packet meets a certain standard of quality, removing ambiguity and ensuring that all contributions are assessed fairly. This system allows Dreamcatcher to connect economic rewards directly to the value of a member's contribution, reinforcing the link between effort and income that seems to have drifted in the traditional capitalistic model.</p><p>Furthermore, Dreamcatcher's model also ensures fair attribution. Once a packet is deemed 'done', it acts like immutable equity that cannot be diluted or taken away. It is owned by all members who contributed to its creation. This innovative approach ensures that those who contribute are fairly and directly rewarded for their efforts, reinforcing the connection between contribution and attribution.</p><p>Moreover, the ability to reuse and recombine packets in multiple applications allows for the creation of passive income streams for the original contributors, further strengthening the link between effort and reward. </p><p>In Dreamcatcher's packet-based innovation market, all members, including funders, do-ers, and buyers, have an equal opportunity to contribute and receive fair reward for their efforts. The QA process ensures that the work done meets the required standards and that the funds are used effectively. Do-ers are rewarded based solely on the quality of their work, and buyers, by virtue of their demand for a product, share in the rewards when the product is built and used.</p><p>In conclusion, packet-based innovation presents a promising avenue for restoring the ancient, primal link between contribution and attribution. By breaking down innovation into quantifiable, quality-assured packets, Dreamcatcher's model ensures that every contribution is fairly rewarded, effectively addressing the distortions and corruptions seen in the traditional flow of wealth. By restoring this essential link, packet-based innovation offers not only a more equitable approach to economic reward, but also a more inclusive and sustainable model for the future of innovation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>"Revolutionizing the Digital Landscape: Inverted Apps, Championing Consumer-Centric Operation"</em></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="bing: an image of a application that has been inverted to serve its consumers rather than its controllers, in the form a swarm of robotic production lines with a colorful starburst as its backdrop" src="/assets/images/2023-05-23-inverted-apps-dawn-1f92da589c5d92a6f99910260a7420fb.jpeg" width="1024" height="1024" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The digital world is continually evolving, and one of the latest advancements is the rise of inverted applications, or "inverted apps." Rooted in the principles of decentralization, these apps are pioneering a new approach to application operation and development, putting consumers first and redefining the notion of control.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-inverted-apps">What are Inverted Apps?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-are-inverted-apps" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Inverted apps are a unique breed of digital applications that put their consumers at the forefront. Instead of following a central authority or rigid structural framework, they coordinate organically while being fractured into many pieces. This decentralization allows them to tailor their operations around the needs and desires of their users, not just their controllers or developers.</p><p>The magic behind this consumer-centric operation is facilitated by the Dreamcatcher platform, which provides the tools and infrastructure for inverted capital allocation mechanisms. These mechanisms allow resources to be distributed in ways that maximize user benefit, leading to a more user-friendly and engaging digital experience.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-power-of-decentralization">The Power of Decentralization<a class="hash-link" href="#the-power-of-decentralization" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The beauty of inverted apps lies in their decentralized structure. Unlike traditional decentralized apps, which often still harbor some form of central control—be it a token or a central registry of intent—inverted apps operate without any central coordination. </p><p>This lack of central authority does not mean that inverted apps are chaotic or disorganized. Instead, any central tendencies that do emerge do so naturally and become apparent only when entities communicate. This fluid and flexible structure allows inverted apps to adapt and evolve in response to user feedback, promoting a more organic and user-centered development process.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-consumer-centric-operation-matters">Why Consumer-Centric Operation Matters<a class="hash-link" href="#why-consumer-centric-operation-matters" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The consumer-centric operation of inverted apps is not just a novel idea—it's a game-changer. For far too long, digital applications have been designed and developed with a top-down approach, with developers or corporations dictating the terms of use and control.</p><p>Inverted apps break away from this paradigm, instead putting the power in the hands of the users. This approach fosters a more engaging and satisfying user experience, as users feel heard and valued, and the apps themselves become more responsive and adaptable.</p><p>The ability of inverted apps to coordinate while being fractured into many pieces also presents several advantages. It allows for a high degree of customization and personalization, as different pieces of the app can adapt to different user needs. Moreover, it increases resilience, as the failure or compromise of one piece does not affect the functionality of the whole.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-future-of-inverted-apps">The Future of Inverted Apps<a class="hash-link" href="#the-future-of-inverted-apps" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The advent of inverted apps marks a significant shift in the digital landscape, one that prioritizes user needs and experiences above all else. As more and more developers embrace this consumer-centric approach, we can expect to see a new generation of digital applications that are more responsive, adaptable, and engaging than ever before.</p><p>While the journey of inverted apps is just beginning, their potential is vast. They represent a powerful testament to the power of decentralization and the importance of putting consumers first. As they continue to evolve and mature, inverted apps are set to redefine our digital experiences, ushering in a new era of consumer-centric operation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

But how does one decide what counts as a "contribution"? And what's more, how does one determine the relative weight of different kinds of contributions? In this post, we'll explore the only two kinds of decisions that need to be made in the Dreamcatcher system in order to answer these questions.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-apportioning-fairly-among-contributions">1.

These could be ideas, funding, software development, QA testing, and more. The question then becomes: how do we apportion attribution fairly among these different contributors?</p><p>To begin with, it's essential to understand that Dreamcatcher operates on the principle of "impact" rather than "effort". That is, the weight of a contribution is measured not by how much time or energy was invested in it, but by its actual impact on the final outcome. </p><p>A robust algorithmic model underpins this decision-making process, assessing the value of each contribution based on a range of parameters. These might include the significance of the contribution to the project, the complexity of the work, and the novelty of the idea, among others. </p><p>Moreover, Dreamcatcher's system is designed to be dynamic and adaptable. As projects evolve and contributions gain or lose relevance, the algorithm adjusts the attribution accorded to each contributor accordingly. This ensures that the attribution system remains fair and accurate, reflecting the ever-changing reality of the project.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-balancing-attribution-between-funders-solvers-and-dependencies">2.

Each of these inputs is essential to the project, and the attribution model should reflect that.</p><p>Attribution is therefore divided proportionally based on the value that each group adds to the project. The exact proportions can vary depending on the project, but the principle remains the same: attribution should reflect the true value of each contribution.</p><p>Just as with individual contributors, this process is also dynamic. As the project evolves and the relative importance of funding, solving, and dependencies changes, so too does the distribution of attribution.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="hash-link" href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Dreamcatcher's attribution model is a complex system, designed to fairly and accurately reward all contributors to a project.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>"Packetisation in the Dreamcatcher vs Decentralised Autonomous Organizations"</em></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="bing: an image of a dao vs a dreamcatcher as a 3d render" src="/assets/images/2023-05-23-dreamcatcher-vs-daos-9b9017034c08e0b25348680eb5819cfc.jpeg" width="1024" height="1024" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Packetised innovation, as exemplified by platforms like Dreamcatcher, offers several advantages over a Decentralised Autonomous Organization (DAO). The model of packetised innovation directly links economic rewards to the value of contributors' input, encouraging everyone to work towards a common goal with the same incentives. It is open to anyone, anywhere, without requiring permission, incentivising high-quality contributions in a barrier-free environment. This process is streamlined by dealing in 'Packets' - unitary pieces of software or knowledge whose quality is verified by a trusted QA and which address a specific need.</p><p>Moreover, the Dreamcatcher platform ensures all members can easily ascertain whether a Packet is 'done' or 'not done,' reducing cost and ambiguity for all involved. The Packets act like immutable equity that cannot be diluted or taken away and are owned by all members who contributed to their creation. They can be traded and can generate revenue streams, ensuring that those who contributed get rewarded. Importantly, these Packets can be re-used in many applications and improved along the way, speeding up development and offsetting costs while providing a passive income stream for original contributors.</p><p>In contrast, while DAOs also operate on principles of decentralisation and transparency, they typically rely on voting mechanisms and workflows for decision-making and control. DAOs, although innovative in their organisational structure, can be hindered by slower decision-making processes due to the requirement of consensus from all members. Additionally, participation in DAOs may be limited to accredited investors only, potentially creating a barrier to entry.</p><p>In summary, packetised innovation allows for more direct, efficient, and inclusive contribution, fostering innovation and value creation while potentially avoiding some of the limitations inherent in DAO structures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This blog post will explore how Dreamcatcher AI extends the principles of Dreamcatcher.land to build a democratic, data-driven innovation attribution system.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-foundation-dreamcatcherland">The Foundation: Dreamcatcher.land<a class="hash-link" href="#the-foundation-dreamcatcherland" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Dreamcatcher.land is a fascinating innovation machine that directly links economic reward to the value of members' contributions, whether they're involved in funding, buying, or building and selling software. This platform operates on the concept of 'Packets', unitary pieces of software or documented knowledge verified by Quality Guardians, which address identified needs. Once a packet is deemed 'done', it acts like immutable equity attributed to all contributing members. This equity can be traded and generate revenue streams, providing a clear reward for contributions. </p><p>The platform's appeal is further enhanced by its ability to reuse and recombine packets across multiple apps, speeding up development and potentially offsetting costs. If reused packets prove useful, Dreamcatcher tracks attribution automatically, ensuring a passive income stream for original contributors. </p><p>The roles within Dreamcatcher's ecosystem are also worth highlighting. Funders inject capital into projects, with the platform's quality assurance process ensuring that the funded work corresponds to their expectations and that payments are released only for packets that contribute to turning their request into a product. 'Do-ers', the innovators who bring packets to life, can work without arbitrary gatekeepers, earning revenue based on the quality of their work. Buyers, on the other hand, are valued for their needs and rewarded for their product requests, contributing to the innovation process from the demand side.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-evolution-dreamcatcher-ai">The Evolution: Dreamcatcher AI<a class="hash-link" href="#the-evolution-dreamcatcher-ai" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Building upon the Dreamcatcher.land foundation, Dreamcatcher AI represents the next evolutionary step in this democratic approach to innovation. It is an attribution artificial intelligence system built on the data generated from the packet-based innovation protocol of Dreamcatcher.land.</p><p>This AI system is designed to answer the often challenging question of revenue distribution based on individual contributions. It examines the vast dataset of interactions on the platform, learns from these experiences, and applies this knowledge to generate fair, informed attribution decisions. With every interaction from any member, the AI deepens its learning, continuously improving its decision-making capabilities.</p><p>Moreover, Dreamcatcher AI introduces an interesting feedback loop that allows members to signal their dissatisfaction with the AI's output, effectively 'teaching' the AI what they believe the attribution should be. This mechanism enables continuous adjustment of the AI's decision-making processes, embodying the spirit of continuous democracy. Every interaction, every feedback point contributes to this ongoing learning process, refining the system's understanding and making it ever more accurate and fair in its attributions.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="democratising-innovation-attribution">Democratising Innovation Attribution<a class="hash-link" href="#democratising-innovation-attribution" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The Dreamcatcher AI brings to life a revolutionary concept: a democratized, data-driven system of innovation attribution. It encourages active participation from all members, learning from their interactions and feedback to refine its understanding of fair attribution. This serves not just to improve the AI's decision-making abilities, but also to make the entire process more transparent and equitable.</p><p>Furthermore, the AI system provides a clear mechanism for members to express their views on attribution, ensuring their voices are heard and considered in the decision-making process. The integration of these feedback loops represents a fundamental shift in how innovation ecosystems can operate, moving from a static, hierarchical structure to a dynamic, democratised system.</p><p>To conclude, Dreamcatcher AI stands at the forefront of a new era of innovation, where data-driven decisions and democratic processes combine to deliver fair and transparent attribution. As members interact with the system, they are not just passive participants but active contributors to the AI's learning. Every interaction, every piece of feedback, is a step towards refining the system and making it more reflective of the collective will of the members. This continuous democratic process holds immense potential for the future of collaborative innovation, painting a promising picture of what's to come. </p><p>Through the combined power of Dreamcatcher.land's packet-based innovation protocol and Dreamcatcher AI's learning and feedback mechanism, we are witnessing a paradigm shift in how we approach innovation. This harmonious blend of technology and democracy brings us closer to a future where every contributor is adequately recognised and rewarded, catalysing a more inclusive and sustainable innovation ecosystem.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>"Revolutionizing the Digital Landscape: Inverted Apps, Championing Consumer-Centric Operation"</em></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="bing: an image depicting the network as the innovator, with the network looking like a dreamcatcher, and the innovator represented by cogs and lightbulbs" src="/assets/images/2023-05-23-network-innovator-1313ffd1ed8bcc93b02b3f71964c0995.jpeg" width="1024" height="1024" class="img_ev3q"></p><h1>Exploring Packet-Switched Innovation Networks</h1><p>In our interconnected world, analogies can often provide insightful perspectives. One such analogy can be drawn between packet-switched networks, circuit-switched networks, dedicated lines, and the evolution of innovation networks.</p><p>For those unfamiliar with the concept, packet-switching is a method of grouping data that is transmitted over a digital network into packets. These packets are then independently routed to their destination, where they are reassembled. This method contrasts with circuit-switching, where a dedicated communication path is established between two points, and all data follows this single path. </p><p>Applying these concepts to innovation networks, we can view each innovation or idea as a packet of information. These packets are transmitted within the network, encountering various routes, obstacles, and changes along the way. </p><p>However, packet-switched networks aren't perfect, and they present two major challenges:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Discontinuity:</strong> Just as packets may arrive at the destination out of order, ideas within an innovation network can be disjointed or lack cohesion. </p></li><li><p><strong>Conversions:</strong> Much like data packets need to be formatted and checked for errors (checksumming) before transmission, innovations often require formalization and validation before they can be implemented. This process can be slow and cumbersome, potentially stifling the pace of innovation.</p></li></ol><p>Despite these challenges, the benefits of a packet-switched approach to innovation are notable. By embracing the inherent discontinuity and conversion processes, we can create an innovation network that is dynamic, resilient, and adaptive. </p><p>In this model, the network itself becomes the innovator. It's not about any single entity driving change, but rather the collective effort of the network, with each node contributing to the overall innovation.</p><p>We can visualize the innovation process as a series of information circuits, each with its unique challenges and opportunities. These circuits may have unreliable operation, delays, lost packets (unrealized ideas), and varying costs. </p><p>However, just as in a packet-switched network, the ability to break down a large packet (or idea) into smaller pieces, transport them via alternate routes, and reassemble them at the destination can prove to be highly effective. This approach allows for parallel processing, resilience in the face of obstacles, and the integration of diverse perspectives.</p><p>In conclusion, viewing innovation through the lens of packet-switching networks opens up exciting possibilities for the way we conceptualize, manage, and execute innovation. By embracing the network as the innovator, we can build a more resilient, adaptive, and efficient innovation ecosystem.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <pubDate>Sun, 19 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The question was: "When asked "what does the Dreamcatcher do ?" how can we include this graph at the heart of what it does ? "oh it makes things fairer" isn't very precise. Showing the wage theft gap as the addressable market for the Dreamcatcher says it has a lot of potential, in provable numbers, I think ?"</p><p>I think we're missing the main point if we talk about removing power from Capital. We're not leading a revolution - we're tuning an old, large engine that could do so much better... But we need to convince Capital and Labour to make it work. We can't do that by being anti-capital.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/Real_GDP_Real_Wages_and_Trade_Policies_in_the_U.S._1947_2014-dc0fc03b9ec821ed0c14048af24b4769.png" width="861" height="691" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Bear with me now, as half an eye to turning this into a blog-piece, and typing this on a phone...
Previously we had two main economic models:</p><p>Labour dominant: Communism at it's core was to remove influence from capital and rent seekers towards Labour. To do that, it was necessary to centralise as there was no pracical alternative. Guessing I don't need to say why centralisation is bad, other than summarising: few brains = bad; many brains = good.</p><p>Capital dominant: Capitalism aimed to decentralise, but failed because of network effects. The more Capital produced, the more than can be produced, and so there's (all else being equal), a exponential effect that accumulates Capital over time. So you inevitably end up with small and reducing group of Capital holders. Not helpful. Again, few brains = bad; many brains = good.</p><p>[Sidenote - this distinction between Capital and Labour is outdated, but going to use it as a traditional framework below. By example, the four of us are working together now. Who's Capital and who's Labour? Say if we hire a guy at half pay, and half Attribution? Who's Capital and who's Labour then? The point is the differentiation is in reality blurred - there just hasn't been a practical way to recognise that until now.]<!-- -->
So what we're proposing is a third way.</p><p>Many brains &lt;-&gt; Many brains = genius.</p><p>NB, no one is losing out here. Both Capital and Labour are improving efficiency. Laying to one side arguments that benefit is relative to your immediate neighbours which you compare yourself with, improving efficiency has got to be a good thing...
AXIOM - Innovation is a good, as of and by itself. Making Innovation more efficient is therefore necessarily good.
So to test this, here's a thought experiment. Two people, one is the Capital guy, the other the Labour guy.</p><p>It's important to note that there is a symetry there. The Capital guy can fire the Labour guy, and the Labour guy can fire the Capital guy (by resigning). But there's an asymetry of information - the information gradient.</p><p>Have talked about this Information Gradient a bit, but this is more important than it may seem. These two don't live in the same world. Capital guy knows about capital; Labour guy knows how to build stuff to make a ROI. Capital guy knows very little about Labour guy's world; Labour guy knows little about Capital guy's world. So we're now approaching a zero-sum game. Each will be looking out for themselves (of course) - even though it would be to the benefit of both if the Project succeeds.
Therefore:
AXIOM - Wherever that's an Information Gradient, there's an inefficient market.
To dig in to the world as seen by each of the players:</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="capital-guy">Capital Guy<a class="hash-link" href="#capital-guy" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The Capital guy is trying to increase his pile by using it to build Stuff, sell Stuff, and make Return on Capital Employed. But he doesn't have the skills, so he needs to give it to some CEO, who will then go off and hire a bunch of people to execute on an idea. To find the CEO he's probably having to look through his local network to N levels of separation, depending on his patience. In my experience, N=2, which is pants.</p><p>He then has to offload his own aim of building his pile to this CEO guy, who then goes out to look for talent to build the idea. That's a fraught process, and I'd argue close to being random selection, based on some filter. So the Capital guy ends up worrying about his Contribution being spanked on marketing socks (Tom, Ben, you get the reference), "Tribe Two" consultants out to gouge a day-rate (Tom, yup, you'll also get the reference), and because of the Information Gradient, Capital Guy has no idea whether his pile will increase or disappear.</p><p>Worth thinking about that for a moment. Capital guy has close to zero control about whether his Contribution will provide a Return, beyond, well, you know, shouting, firing people, closing the company etc.</p><p>The result is that start-up investment is seen as ludicrously risky, and so the risk multiplier means that the Capital guy would be an idiot to not grab as large a percentage of the pie as possible, even before the pie is ready to go in the oven.</p><p>In addition, at the early stages, Capital guy has the Information Gradient in his favour. Two guys in a garage vs Round-A $3m...</p><p>I do have a lot of sympathy for the Capital guy though. Being out of control sucks. Capital guys doesn't have real control, beyond raising, hiring, firing and folding. So small number of Big Hammers...</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="labour-guy">Labour Guy<a class="hash-link" href="#labour-guy" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>OK, so other side of the coin, the Labour Guy. Labour Guy has more direct control over what's produced, but they have perverse incentives (cf Adam Smith). You could work hard on what the Capital guy wants you to do, but you're also interested in increasing your pile. How to do that? A smart Labour guy will be trading off working full tilt on the Project, setting up their own Project, maybe gouging for salary while the going is good.</p><p>But again the Information Gradient kicks in. Capital guy has identified that there's a large risk, and so will be holding as much of the pie as possible for as long as possible. Labour guy can bake that pie, but won't go full tilt if he's not going to get any. It's a zero-sum game.</p><p>Again, Information Gradient = inefficient market.</p><p>So we get the weirdness of two groups, who if they cooperated with each other could build The Thing, expecting that it's a zero sum game and, using the tools each have to hand, trying to maximise their own return not the important thing, which is to see whether That Thing is useful in the market.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dreamcatcher">Dreamcatcher<a class="hash-link" href="#dreamcatcher" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>AXIOM: Dreamcatcher intends to reduce and ultimately remove the inefficiencies we see now in Innovation.
From the Capital guy's point of view, the ideal situation is that the Labour guy is working full tilt on the Project. Ie, there's zero Information Gradient between what the Capital guy wants and what the Labour guy wants.</p><p>From the Labour guy's point of view, the ideal situation is that the Capital guy will give him his full worth of the effort he puts in. Ie, there's zero Information Gradient between what the Capital guy wants and what the Labour guy wants.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/Labor_capital_balance-981f029551c689692d5a5f8443b54bd5.jpg" width="1485" height="839" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>So there's a potential here that there is no information gradient, and that both groups have exactly the same incentives
And that's my point. Dreamcatcher isn't anti-capital, anti-rent-seakers (although I hate rent-seekers). It is about working towards making Innovation maximally efficient, which isn't a zero-sum game. If it works, everyone benefits...
@everyone Feel passionately about this. Know we have a lot going back and forth, but would love it if one of you guys would kick the shit out of what I've said above. Right now, for me, that reduction in inefficiency of innovation is everything, and we need to lead with that not being a zero-sum game...</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/inverted_applications-7dfbef9e72c11ed17714654dadb6c345.jpg" width="800" height="350" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Distributed apps at best can have tamper detection.</p><p>Decentralized apps at best can have censor resistance.</p><p>Consider then a github clone with a central token. Once roughly 51% of all the governance tokens have been controlled, which could be done by censoring maybe three or four people if not distributed well, then the entire app is at the will of the censor. Worse, perhaps the underlying blockchain is overthrown somehow - then the github token goes down as collateral (excuse the pun) damage. The problem is confounded by the requirement that surviving blockchain operators need to communicate with each other, as forking is considered a system failure. This repeated communication makes them easy targets. Yes, the system could start again as soon as the first copy re-appears and starts operating, but during that window the censor is in control - supression is the norm.</p><p>An inverted version of github makes its own dedicated set of blockchains for each git repo that anyone wishes to host. These apps might communicate with each other, and might even trade using some currency selections. They might share block producers, they might not.</p><p>To take down an inverted app requires finding all the blockhosts and all the key owners of all the github repos that every get created using this means of operation. The problem is far thornier than the other classes of apps. We believe this is censorship proof operation - if a censor can find every actor who is running a copy of the software. Whole subsegments of user can go offnet, and run local only. You can only supress what you can detect, and so this is the worst possible scenario of any censorship effort - we should strive for this, and not accept inferior systems that offer anything less that censorship proof apps for everyday users.</p><p>Email is an example of a sort of inverted app. It has massive distribution, it is not centrally controlled. The central control however, is exerted by the DNS namespace, and the IP allocation tables of the internet. but it has many of the characteristics, and its wild spread indicates the scale for these types of apps. It could be that email is the simplest form of such a thing, as it really just does transmission and receiving. More complex and more useful interactions such as long form stateful collaborations have yet to see such an exlosion, but git offers a glimpse of what that could be like. If only git came with its own independent version of github wrapped around every repo that was created. Its components lack the resilience and internal integrity necessary to travel thru many inverted instances unaltered.</p><p>The first inverted app is the dreamcatcher. Each idea is free floating, owned by its creator and optionally private. Then projects are created - themselves a form of idea - to capture these ideas, seek missing ideas, and refine them into something usable. Each project is entirely sovereign to itself, optionally run by whomever has compute capacity to do so. It is completely free of any centralized token control, system control, or even version control. It can, at the freewill of its owners, communicate with other organisms such as itself, or with other external systems such as email.</p><p>The spreading of a codebase creates a desire for future improvements to that program. This is primarily how we get paid, and the service we are offering - future improvements quickly, of quality. The more people get copies of our software, the more pressure is created.</p><p>The power of enduring social pressure. The emergent will of a thousand whispers.</p><p>Inverted apps put their consumer first, and coordinate while being fractured into many pieces. inverted apps harness the inverted capital allocation mechanisms enabled by dreamcatchers to perform functions in line with the benefit of their consumers, not their controllers. Distributed apps spread the operation of an application across multiple physical machines with control held by a central entity. Almost all cloud applications that hope to offer any kind of reliability operate in this way. Decentralized apps are distributed apps that spread the central control amongst many entities, often dynamically. Whilst the control may be spread around, the central control is still fiercely present, usually in the form of a token as a central registry of intent. Inverted apps are the opposite of these forms, in that there is no central coordination of intent, but rather any central tendencies emerges, without force or registration, and are apparent when entities communicate. For example, the collection of all bitcoin chain forks is a crude form of inverted app - the forks do not communicate well with each other, but their central token registries are at least partially split from each other to serve the needs of their respective user groups, and sometimes they coordinate via exchanges where overall, the utility of cryptocurrencies of this class is enhanced. Inverted apps can easily wrap controlled apps, but controlled apps are incapable of wrapping inverted. Inverted can wrap inverted. Inverted can emulate controlled where needed. Almost all blockchains could currently be classed as perverted apps - proporting to offer freedom, but really having no more structure than a public company with central product and distributed public shareholdings. These operations have no future.</p><p>an inverted exchange is different to an exchange on a blockchain. True inversion means that any partipant can come and go if the possess commodity electronics. Ethereum for example you need to have ETH, then you need assets on the chain - the list of barriers goes on and on. An inverted exchange would let people peer with one another and find the best prices. Yes there would appear aggregators, but these would be assistants, and easily replaced at any time they stop being useful.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="No SaaS" src="/assets/images/no-more-software-7f0bf35734eb2392d46e0393f283fd37.png" width="277" height="182" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>A new software delivery model for SaaS is <a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/open-core-vs-saas-intro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emerging</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dreamcatcher aims to provide a mechanism for alternate views on all aspects of a Project not only to co-exist, but to combine to improve that project and all Forks of that project.</p><p>This stems from the belief that it’s hard to see individually what particular opinions are correct ahead of time, and that the more outlandish opinions may often be the most valuable. It also stems from the belief that in gathering many opinions, de-duplicating and combining them to become more precise, and by combining the judgement of many people in deciding their worth, we’re maximising the chance of making the right decisions.</p><p>This approach is across the board. It applies just as much to how a Project is governed, how it’s funds are spent as it does to what work should be undertaken and whether it’s complete.</p><p>That is, the method of consideration needs in itself to be open to opinion and consideration.</p><p>This is important because, generally, the closer you are to the work, the clearer your thoughts on the appropriateness of that work. Likewise, the closer you are to the overall goals, the clearer your thoughts are on those. The DC needs to capture both, filter and apply wide knowledge on assessing them.</p><p>We want to be able to capture the fringe ideas because that's where the big gains come from. We also simultaneously want to manage a wealth of fringe ideas without being paralysesed when those ideas are incompatible with each other.</p><p>The Principles are:</p><ol><li>Give us everything.

something more sustainable, and how can we get more software, of a higher
quality, faster, and cost lest money ?</p><p>The utopian model of knowledge work is that all individuals permissionlessly contribute to whatever they are able, in whatever form they can, and can build on all prior contributions from anyone else, while receiving fair recompense based on the value they provided whenever their work is used and reused, all with zero overhead. This utopia is focused on providing pure utility to consumers, and enabling pure contribution from producers. This environment would be ideal Ambient Attribution.</p><p>To implement such perfection in our current reality needs compromise and ingenuity. A pragmatic form of Ambient Attribution as presented here has mechanisms to handle corruption, fairness discovery, attack mitigation (eg: lawsuits and corporation pressures), dishonesty, disputes, transaction costs, and management overheads, all while avoiding the perils of central system control. Whilst the perfected version may be some decades away technologically, we see within the rise of blockchains, the basic components required to implement a first iteration.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>"Mixing the pure with the impure, without making everything impure"</em></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/mixing-droplet-cc99a7cf93ede713e25b9f9bd1091783.jpg" width="4856" height="3380" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The work I have been doing lately could largely be described as side effect management. This is the means by which to introduce external data into the blockchain based system, in a way that does not corrupt the key blockchain property of reproducibility. That is to say, being able to rerun blocks thru different computers and verify that the same answer came out. Side effects are any external event - something that cannot be reproduced - a simple example is receiving an email. The converse is required too - being able to use the pure, clean, secure blockchain based calculations to trigger unreproducible external events. A simple example of this is sending an email.</p><p>So the work is about making something unrepeatable become something repeatable in a clean way, and to a lesser extent making something repeatable trigger unrepeatable events.</p><p>However during the work I was doing to send internet packets between Amazon and the browser the amount of code I was writing that was not blockchain related started to increase. The problem with this is that it is not reusing the code that is used for the blockchains, and so requires extra work to build and maintain, while losing the very helpful traceability properties that blockchain based calculations afford. Traceability becomes especially useful when the software is executing on remote servers.</p><p>This was the trigger for the work, but it is work that would have been required later anyway.</p><p>I have managed to get the underlying system of side effects working in prototype form, and starting from this morning I will be applying that to the internet transport ability. I am pleased with how the system is performing, and it meets my goals of being clean and simple and easy to fault find. An example of why the fault finding aspect is useful is that if you call me and say that at roughly 10am something weird happened in the app and you can't seem to make it happen again, we would be able to see the actual interactions the application made and very quickly be able to reproduce the problem, making fixing it much faster, and giving you reassurance that we did actually know what is going on, rather than having to ask you to keep an eye out for it happening again because we can't notice anything amiss.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Also company 1 and the livelihoods of all their staff are destroyed by a mass switch, when perhaps the majority of the company did good work. Then the process repeats again for company 2.</p><p>We propose a means by which there is really only one company, and the members cooperate at whim, and the consumers pay down whichever paths suit them best.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="outsourcing-your-identity-management-requirements">Outsourcing your identity management requirements.<a class="hash-link" href="#outsourcing-your-identity-management-requirements" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In such an ecosystem, the dangerous job of correlating identities need only be managed by a handful of services.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="exceeding-quality-of-registered-companies">Exceeding quality of registered companies<a class="hash-link" href="#exceeding-quality-of-registered-companies" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Companies do bad things all the time. Clearly being registered is no guarantee of good behaviour. With zero liability, the responsibily shifts onto the community to maintain opinion... This correlates with a shift in social mob justice of suspected bad actors.</p><p>Complete anonymity and business models that still work (hopefully!) even tho buy side and sell side do not know who each other are.</p><p>Making a functioning revenue stream when there is no force available - how to make money from open source software.</p><p>Transparency of companies is somewhat like how on a unix system, the operating system is largely readable by all users, but only writable by a trusted few. It helps the users to know whats going on.</p><p>We only care about the work generated. Work is hard, and full of thorns as the level of detail increases. Being zero liability and anonymous frees people to focus solely on the work, and frees consumers to look only at the value of that work to them, independent of any other forces that can alter perception away from cold purity of value. It is then up to the producer to choose to declare what they have done - this is optional, whereas under the current systems it is required, and criminally punished.</p><p>Moreover, we have implemented ways in which people can partially declare properties about themselves and their work rather than a full destruction of privacy. For example you can declare yourself a tax resident of x country for the projects you contributed there, and you can pay tax to that country, but you need not assosciate your name with it.</p><p>The bringers of novel knowledge are often unwelcomed, some violently so (references). For this reason, the Dreamcatcher network is designed such that any contributors of work or funds are free to stay anonymous, and at their wish only reveal as much as they wish. They can also release graduated information rather than all or nothing. Indeed consumers within the network also can operate this way, and share any portion of their consumption data on the network</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="operating-activities">Operating Activities<a class="hash-link" href="#operating-activities" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ol><li>Real life promotion (conferences, videos, friends)</li><li>Online Promotion (forums, emails, blogs)</li><li>Code commits</li><li>Issue posting</li><li>TESTING Amazon deployments using serverless.com tooling</li><li>PRODUCTION Amazon deployments using serverless.com tooling</li></ol><p>the concept of the zero liability company only the code matters</p>]]></content:encoded>
